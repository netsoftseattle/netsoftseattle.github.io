on Google search. Also if fee is small it's easy to say "well if you

color:#333333'><span style=3D'position:relative;left:.125in'>2. The extranet
service has been almost impossible to sell, even though its yearly fee isnt
that high either. Why? Well, because people don't see any benefit using it.=
 If
they want to communicate and send files they use email. And since it's not
compulsory to join this extranet service, they say "well I get all mee=
ting
informations and files via e-mail anyway". Kinda hard to argue with th=
at
because it's true, and I also think it's useless before people realize what=
 is
the benefit of extranet/intranet applications. As long as people only use
e-mail and got that lightbulb in their head which blings, it's useless. So =
if
you are selling something, sell it to people who understand the product/ser=
vice
and what it is used for. Otherwise it's pretty useless.</span></p>

if that person-telling-about-this-subject doesn't give up and just pushes m=

never buy anything from them". I think it's inside seller's head to he=

or see when there is a chance. People who made the contract had some knowle=

about it, and first said like "well we've thought about it but dunno if
there is any benefit". Then I told them the benefits and they got curi=

do is to call to another group of people and try to sell our own
www-applications. That's going to be more challenging, but I have one good
advantage: I've been coding many of them and know every detail about them. =
We
also had a salesman about an year ago and we noticed one problem: he didn't
understand our products. He understood roughly what extranet does but when
clients asked more details and "is this change possible" he could=
n't
say anything. When trying to sell tailored applications that can be almost
anything I think it's impossible if you don't have any experience of making
them. Knowing the limits, knowing roughly does this task take 10 or 100 hou=

etc. So if you are hiring or thinking to hire a salesman be sure he has the
knowledge of _YOUR_ business - or he is able to get that knowledge. </span>=
