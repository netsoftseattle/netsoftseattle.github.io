      <p>Racing, running, and restaurateuring.<br>
        Gerard Bisceglia rarely sits still. </p>
      <p>In fact, he has always had a thirst for fast-paced environments <br>
        and immense challenges,</p>
      <p>Ever heard of a Slurpee?<br>
        Ever had a Big Gulp?<br>
        Those were just two of the milestones from Gerard¡¯s decades of <br>
        sales &amp; marketing leadership for America¡¯s 8,000 7-ELEVEN stores.</p>
      <p>Not one to rest on his laurels, he jumped to Circle K and, as VP of Marketing, 
        helped transform a bankrupt chain into a billon-dollar Cinderella in under 
        three years.</p>
      <p>(Although Gerard tried to rest, the closest he came was restaurants,<br>
        reviving the fortunes of TGI Fridays in under two years.)</p>
      <p>However, his most dramatic footwork happened on just two wheels. As CEO 
        of USA Cycling, the governing body for competitive cycling in America, 
        Gerard reversed the group¡¯s 7-year long decline by sprinting straight 
        up the charts to a 39% increase in membership and a 330% increase in reserves. 
        Not to mention global recognition for the US Olympic cycling team. </p>
      <p>Today, Gerard earns his yellow jersey by showing companies how to get 
        the most mileage from the grandest audience of all.<br>
