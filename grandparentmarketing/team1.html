        President, Creative Director</p>
      <p>Analytical, deliberative, pensive. <br>
        Not the adjectives you¡¯d expect to describe someone <br>
        who has won every major international award for creativity. </p>
      <p>However, David Levy is not your typical Creative Director.</p>
      <p>After earning his stripes on General Foods and Johnson &amp; Johnson 
        at DDB and Y&amp;R New York, David headed west to lead the Seattle office 
        of Cole &amp; Weber where his ingenuity earned Andys, Clios, Addys, and 
        the award for ¡°World¡¯s Best Radio Commerical.¡±</p>
      <p>Just as software began to make its mark, David joined the country¡¯s<br>
        leading software retailer. As Vice President of Marketing at Egghead, 
        <br>
        he built the team that created the software industry¡¯s most successful 
        <br>
        marketing programs.</p>
      <p>Yet as fast as Egghead was growing, it couldn¡¯t contain David¡¯s ambitions.<br>
        So, in 1989, he launched Levy&amp;Wurz Channel Marketing, the world¡¯s 
        first channel marketing agency. </p>
      <p>During the ensuing decade, his firm earned every major industry award 
        for work with high-tech¡¯s most admired brands, including: IBM, Microsoft, 
        Apple, Electronic Arts, Intuit, and Symantec.</p>
      <p>Today, David¡¯s decades of experience and creativity are focused<br>
        on influencing the grandest audience of all.<br>
