        Are An Untapped Market</a><br>

      <p>&quot;We're not just talking about toys, either. Grandparents are spending 
        more on travel, computers, recreation, financial services, and entertainment. 
        They have the wherewithal financially ¡ª more so than their children ¡ª 
        to buy and travel and do all those things the parents can't do.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Most elderly people today are better off than they thought they 
        would be, with the booming stock market of the 1990's, the rising value 
        of homes and the changes in Social Security. Meanwhile, their kids are 
        worse off than they thought they would be. So grandparents help out.&quot;</p>

        Kiplinger Report on Boomer Grandparents</a></p>
      <p>&quot;Then there's the entertainment market. Having grown up on rock 
        and roll, boomers will be far more likely than their senior parents to 
        share their grandchildren's musical interests. That means not only that 
        they'll spend more on compact discs for their grandkids, but also that 
        they'll be joining them in the stands at rock concerts. Similarly, they'll 
        be more likely to take them out to restaurants, movies and sporting events.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Affluent and educated, the boomer group is lavishing attention 
        on their grandkids. So don't forget that the oldster marketing juggernaut 
        includes consumer electronics, trendy toys and kid experiences.&quot;</p>

        While grandparents shower marketers <br>
        with opportunity, few are returning the favor</p>
      <p>&quot;While some marketers have latched onto doting Ompas and Nonas, 
        many others haven't yet identified them, despite the tremendous opportunities 
        they present. Grandparents are out there in great and growing numbers 
        these days, and they live in large part to lavish their grandkids with 
        their largesse.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Boomers and pre-matures have embraced new technology. Their purchase 
        and use of computers, cell phones, PDAs, etc. is at least equal to that 
        of those younger¡ªand in some cases even greater. They have embraced the 
        Internet¡ªand not only to email their children and grandchildren¡ªbut also 
        for online banking, shopping and research.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;What's driving the grandparent/grandchild globetrotting? Demographics. 
        Older adults¡ªthose in their sixties, seventies, and eighties¡ªare generally 
        healthier, wealthier, and better traveled than their predecessors. Right 
        on their heels are the oldest baby boomers, already in their mid fifties, 
        and, as a group, even more frequent business and pleasure travelers. For 
        many, grandtripping offers an ideal way to combine two great passions: 
        traveling and spending private time with their children's children.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;My grandad is really cool, he's only 48 and rides in leather on 
        his motorbike! Plus, he knows how to use all the latest gadgets and stuff! 
        He's like a second dad to me.&quot;</p>

        Intergenerational camps help grandparents <br>
        form a lasting bond with their grandchildren</p>
      <p> &quot;Here's the best part: when they returned home, Sadie asked if 
        they could do something together again next year. 'Now when I go visit 
        she hugs me, and then often we'll sit and talk or read a book together,' 
        Abler says. 'We're building a wonderful bond.'&quot;<br>
